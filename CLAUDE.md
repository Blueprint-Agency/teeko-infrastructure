# Infrastructure Repository

Central infrastructure-as-code repo. Manages all VPS, Docker deployments, CI/CD, monitoring, and GitHub org.

## Credentials Rule

**All credentials live in `.env` only.** Never hardcode tokens or passwords anywhere else. `.env` is gitignored. Use `.env.example` as the template.

## Two Accounts — Read This First

**Only Cloudflare and Hostinger are split.** Everything else is single-tenant. Verified 2026-08-09.

| | Teeko | Blueprint |
|---|---|---|
| Cloudflare account | `Teekoaitech@gmail.com` | `Askblueprintagency@gmail.com` |
| Zones | teeko.ai | kaiteki.my, blueprintdigital.my, reservetoday.app ⚠️ |
| Hostinger account | ⚠️ unknown — see below | holds bpvps1 + bpvps2 |
| Hosts | vps1-staging, vps2-prod, vps3-prod | bpvps1, bpvps2 |
| CI (`deploy-infra.yml`) | automated | **not** automated — deploy by hand |

> ⚠️ **`reservetoday.app` is in the Blueprint Cloudflare account but Cloudflare does NOT serve
> it.** Its nameservers are `ns1`/`ns2.vercel-dns.com` — Vercel is authoritative, and the
> Cloudflare zone is a staged copy for a nameserver move that has not happened. Editing it
> changes nothing that resolves. Use `vercel dns ls|add|rm reservetoday.app` (scope
> `blueprintdigitalmy`). Verified 2026-08-31. See `docs/tls-wildcard-constraint.md`.

Shared across both, with **no** per-account split:

| | Single tenant |
|---|---|
| GitHub | one org, `Blueprint-Agency` |
| Vercel | one team, `askblueprintagency-7138s-projects` — holds `teeko-ehailing-*` **and** `booking-system-*`, `blueprint-marketing-website`, `vatti-web`, `persistence-chiro` |
| Tailscale | one tailnet, `taild19da3.ts.net` — all 5 VPS are members |

> ⚠️ The GitHub PAT can also see **`Inquantum-AI`** — a different client's org. Same hazard as the
> bare `vps1-staging` / `vps2-prod` SSH aliases. Check the org name before any write via the REST API.

## MCP Servers

The configured servers, the account-suffix rule, and the scoped-binary rule all live in
`.mcp.json.example` (`_comment_*` keys). Read that, not a copy of it.

**Deliberately not MCP servers.** **GitHub** — `curl` + REST with the `.env` PAT covers repos,
secrets and environments in ~4 calls; an MCP adds ~90 tools. **Tailscale** — no official server
exists and the community ones are unsupported. **`hostinger-{dns,domains,hosting,mail,reach}`** —
both accounts own zero registered domains and zero hosting/mail subscriptions, so these would
manage nothing. DNS is Cloudflare, mail is self-hosted Stalwart.

> ⚠️ **VPS1/2/3 are in no Hostinger account we hold a token for — parked, not solved.** Verified
> 2026-08-09: the Teeko token authenticated (`/vps/v1/data-centers` returned 9; a bogus token 401s)
> but `/vps/v1/virtual-machines`, `/domains/v1/portfolio` and `/billing/v1/subscriptions` all
> returned **empty**. The Blueprint token sees only bpvps1 + bpvps2. So `72.61.114.7`,
> `72.60.235.226`, `72.62.74.77` live under a **third login**. **No `hostinger-*-teeko` server is
> configured**, because one would answer "VPS not found" instead of failing loudly. VPS1/2/3
> firewalls and snapshots stay hPanel-only until the right account is found.

> The Teeko token itself was **removed from `.env` on 2026-08-27** and should be revoked in
> hPanel. Nothing read it — no MCP server, no script, no workflow — so it was a live credential
> guarding nothing. If the third login is ever found, generate a **fresh** token there; do not go
> looking for this one. (Hostinger's API sits behind Cloudflare and 403s `error code: 1010` on a
> bare urllib request — send a normal `User-Agent`, or a live token looks dead.)

**GitHub**: use `git` (bash) for repo operations and `curl` + GitHub REST API for org/repo
management, secrets, and environments. PAT in `.env` as `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
No GitHub MCP and no `gh` CLI installed — don't reach for either.

**VPS/Docker**: use `ssh bp-vps1-staging` / `ssh bp-vps2-prod` / `ssh bp-vps3-prod` directly.
The Hostinger MCP does **not** replace SSH — it is the hypervisor control plane (power, firewall,
snapshots), and cannot see inside the VM. Anything about containers, files, logs, or `docker
compose` is still SSH.

## VPS Access

| Alias | Role | Specs |
|-------|------|-------|
| `bp-vps1-staging` | Staging | 2 vCPU / 8GB / 100GB |
| `bp-vps2-prod` | Production | 4 vCPU / 16GB / 200GB |
| `bp-vps3-prod` | Production | 4 vCPU / 16GB / 200GB |
| `bp-bpvps1` | Kaiteki (legacy + revamp) | 187.127.122.41 |
| `bp-bpvps2` | Booking-system | 187.127.207.82 |

SSH key: `~/.ssh/infra_ed25519`. All hosts log in as **`deploy`**, not root — `deploy` is in the `docker` group and owns `/root/stacks`. Hosts defined in `~/.ssh/config`.

> `deploy` has **no sudo** — only `docker` group membership. Root login is still permitted on purpose:
> it is the break-glass path for anything daemon-level, including the Docker 29.x systemd drop-in
> below. Don't set `PermitRootLogin no` without granting `deploy` sudo first, or that fix becomes
> unappliable. (VPS1/2/3 `deploy` accounts got the `chriskke-infra` key on 2026-08-09; before that
> only the CI key was authorized and interactive logins went in as root.)

> ⚠️ **Always use the `bp-` prefix.** The bare aliases `vps1-staging` / `vps2-prod` in `~/.ssh/config` belong to a **different client (Inquantum AI)** on a different key — operating on them by mistake hits the wrong company's servers. There is no bare `vps3-prod`.

> ⚠️ **`bp-bpvps2` is NOT `bp-vps2-prod`.** One is the booking-system host; the other is live teeko.ai production. They differ by two characters. Re-read the alias before any `docker compose down`, volume removal, or `psql` write.

## What's Running

Per-host stack list is `ls vps/<host>/stacks/`; container names and domains are in each stack's
compose labels; the app → VPS → image → domain mapping is `apps/registry.yml`. bpvps2 is the one
host whose on-host dirs differ from the repo: a single `booking` stack fans out to
`booking-staging` + `booking-prod` per `vps/hosts.json`.

> `docs/running-services.md` is a **2026-07-21 snapshot**, refreshed for bpvps2 on 2026-08-31
> (booking moved off VPS3 and now has its own section). Everything else in it is still that
> July snapshot — treat the other hosts as history, not as inventory.

Four things the compose files will not tell you — all of them "do not prune":

> The `n8n` stack on VPS3 carries **three** containers, not two: `n8n-prod`, `n8n-db`, and
> `waba-db` (service `db-waba`, `postgres:alpine`). `waba-db` is a separate database that happens to
> live in the n8n compose, with no app container running against it — don't read it as an orphan.

> **ga4-mcp / gsc-mcp stacks**: each is 3 containers (`*-mcp` backend, `*-gateway` OAuth 2.1 front,
> `*-dex` IdP) and **all three are required** to serve `https://ga4.teeko.ai/mcp` and
> `https://gsc.teeko.ai/mcp`. The `*-mcp` backends have no public route. None are redundant.

> **booking-system is multi-tenant.** One deployment serves every studio; a studio is a
> Tenant row in `tenants`, never its own stack, container or database. Never add a stack
> per customer. `booking-staging` (api.dev.reservetoday.app) carries the real data;
> `booking-prod` (api.reservetoday.app) is fresh. Both live on **bpvps2** since the
> 2026-07-21 move off VPS3. The domains are on `reservetoday.app` — the registry claimed
> `bookingapi.teeko.ai` until 2026-08-31, which was drift, not the truth. bpvps2 cannot
> issue a wildcard for that zone: see [`docs/tls-wildcard-constraint.md`](docs/tls-wildcard-constraint.md).

> **Portainer and pgAdmin are gone** (removed 2026-07-21) — no container UI at all. Postgres is
> managed via drizzle-gateway on all 3 Teeko VPS (`stagingpg` / `pg` / `pg3`.teeko.ai), all sharing
> the `GATEWAY_MASTERPASS` secret.

## Architecture

Topology, registry and database choices are in `README.md`; per-app detail is `apps/registry.yml`.
Timezone: **Asia/Kuala_Lumpur**.

> ⚠️ **A Cloudflare token cannot span accounts, and Traefik reads `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN`
> process-wide.** bpvps2's token is a **Teeko** token (teeko.ai only), so DNS-01 there cannot
> issue for `reservetoday.app` / `kaiteki.my` / `blueprintdigital.my` — it fails with
> `cloudflare: failed to find zone …: zone could not be found`. Adding a second DNS-01 resolver
> does **not** help: both resolvers would read the same env var. bpvps2 therefore carries a
> second resolver, **`le-tls`** (TLS-ALPN-01 on :443, no credentials), used by the booking
> stacks. It requires the record to be **DNS-only** — a Cloudflare-proxied (orange) host
> terminates TLS at the edge and the challenge never lands — and it cannot issue wildcards.
> Keep `letsencrypt` (DNS-01) for teeko.ai and for any wildcard.

## CI/CD

`.github/workflows/deploy-infra.yml` deploys **all five hosts** from one matrix job.
`vps/hosts.json` is the source of truth and documents its own fields inline. The ordered procedure
for onboarding a host or adding a stack is the **`provision` skill**
(`.claude/skills/provision/SKILL.md`) — read that rather than a summary here.

`staging` branch → VPS1; `main` → VPS2 or VPS3. App images are built by each app's own repo, which
then triggers the deploy.

### Per-stack secrets live in `ci/`, never in the workflow

**`deploy-infra.yml` knows nothing about any individual stack.** A stack that needs generated files
carries them itself in `vps/<host>/stacks/<stack>/ci/`, as templates with `@@MARKER@@` placeholders;
`render-ci.py` fills each marker from the same-named env var in the deploy step and rsyncs the
result. The `provision` skill has the path-by-path contract. **Never add a branch to the workflow.**

> An unset or empty marker **fails the deploy**. This is deliberate: a blank secret is not a smaller
> failure than a missing file — it is a Dex with no admin password that starts happily and serves
> 401s, or a Postgres that initialises a brand new empty database. `render-ci.py` names the variable
> and the file and exits 1. `vps/shared/test_render_ci.py` covers this and runs as a CI step.

> **`.env` is MERGED, not replaced.** CI-owned keys (`BASE_DOMAIN`, `ACME_EMAIL`,
> `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN`, `TRAEFIK_DASHBOARD_AUTH`, `ENV_NAME`, plus whatever the stack's own `ci/env.ci`
> contributes) win; every other line, comments included, is preserved. This is what lets stacks keep
> host-managed values such as booking's `BOOKING_HOST`/`IMAGE_TAG`. App repo deploys are compatible
> with this: `booking-system` rewrites its own keys idempotently, and `ehailing` / `kaiteki-web`
> write only their own `.env.*` files, which CI's rsync excludes.

> `GA4_MCP_PATH_TOKEN` left the host-wide key list on 2026-08-09 and moved to
> `ga4-mcp/ci/env.ci`, where it belongs — only ga4-mcp's compose reads it, but it was previously
> written into **every** stack's `.env` on **every** host. Stale copies still sit in other stacks'
> `.env` files; they are inert, and the merge no longer refreshes them.

> **`env_name` is per fanout destination, not per host.** bpvps2 deploys one `booking` compose into
> `booking-staging` and `booking-prod`. A host-level `ENV_NAME` would give both `prod`, making
> booking-**staging** resolve to booking-prod's container, volume and network — on the instance that
> holds the real data.

> A stack dir must be owned by **`deploy`** for CI to deploy it — `root:root` fails silently at
> rsync. That is why bpvps1's `stalwart` / `traefik` / `wordpress` are still in `exclude` in
> `vps/hosts.json`, which records the reason per host. Check ownership before onboarding.

### ⚠️ Org-level vars are consumed by OTHER repos — check before deleting one

`deploy-infra.yml` reads only `vars.TAILSCALE_HOST` (per-Environment). Every other `*_TAILSCALE_HOST`
org variable exists for a **different repo's** deploy workflow. The org holds exactly **8**:

| Org variable | Consumed by |
|---|---|
| `VPS1_TAILSCALE_HOST`, `VPS2_TAILSCALE_HOST` | `teeko-website` → `be-deploy.yml`, `fe-deploy.yml` |
| `VPS3_TAILSCALE_HOST` | `teeko-ehailing` → `deploy-backend.yml` |
| `BPVPS1_TAILSCALE_HOST` | `kaiteki-web` → `deploy-prod.yml`, `deploy-staging.yml` |
| `BPVPS2_TAILSCALE_HOST` | `booking-system` → `deploy-be.yml` |
| `ACME_EMAIL`, `BASE_DOMAIN`, `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | infra + every app build |

> **The GitHub code-search API does not index these workflow files.** A `/search/code?q=VPS1_HOST`
> returns `total_count: 0` for names that are demonstrably in use. On 2026-08-09 that false
> negative got `VPS1_HOST` deleted while `teeko-website` still needed it. **Verify by reading
> `.github/workflows/` from each repo's contents API**, never by code search.

> **Strip comments before deciding a variable is unused.** `teeko-ehailing` carries the line
> `# SSH in over Tailscale (was the public vars.VPS3_HOST before Tailscale)`. A naive
> `vars\.([A-Z_]+)` match reads that as a live reference and keeps a dead variable alive forever.
> The comment is accurate history — leave it; just don't count it.

> `booking-system`'s deploy runs `db:migrate && db:seed`, and **`booking-staging` carries the real
> data** — so exercise that deploy on `main`, not `staging`.

> **Seven secrets referenced by app workflows do not exist anywhere** (checked repo-level, and every
> environment, as both secret and variable). Each is silently written as an empty value into the
> app's `.env`: `booking-system` → `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`,
> `R2_PUBLIC_URL`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (object storage — uploads);
> `teeko-ehailing` → `CLERK_DRIVER_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `CLERK_RIDER_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`
> (webhook signature verification).

## Operational Notes

### Firewall (Hostinger VPS panel)

**Port 22 is CLOSED to the internet on all five hosts as of 2026-08-09.** SSH is tailnet-only.
Otherwise open: **80**, **443**. Close everything else — especially 3000, 5432, 5678, 8080, 9090
(reached via Traefik only) and 9001 (portainer-agent, no longer needed).

| Host | How |
|---|---|
| bpvps1, bpvps2 | group 319466 rule 22 restricted to `100.64.0.0/10`, then synced (API) |
| vps1-staging, vps2-prod, vps3-prod | hPanel — different Hostinger account, no API token |

Current 319466 rules: **25, 80, 443, 465, 587, 993, 995** `accept TCP` from any, plus **22**
`accept TCP` from **`100.64.0.0/10` only** (the Tailscale CGNAT range). Rule 22 was **restricted
rather than deleted** — reversible, self-documenting, and the tailnet source keeps a way in
without recreating a rule.

> bpvps1 and bpvps2 **share** group `319466` — editing it hits both, and syncing one VM applies it
> to both. The sync action sits in state `started` for ~100s; the rules do **not** take effect until
> it reaches `success`. Poll `/virtual-machines/<id>/actions/<actionId>` rather than trusting the
> group's `is_synced` flag, which flips to `true` while the action is still running.

> Testing ports from a laptop is unreliable: home ISPs block outbound **25**, so it reads BLOCKED
> even when open, and an unsynced firewall reads OPEN long after the rule looks right. Re-test
> server-to-server (`ssh bp-vps3-prod` → `/dev/tcp/<ip>/<port>`). Port **587** reads BLOCKED
> because nothing listens on it, not because of the firewall.

**Key expiry is DISABLED on all five nodes** (2026-08-09, verified: `Self.KeyExpiry` absent on
every host). This is what makes a tailnet-only SSH policy survivable — before it, vps1/vps2/vps3
were all set to expire **2026-12-14**, which would have taken staging and both Teeko production
hosts on the same day. An expired key drops the node off the tailnet, which with port 22 closed
means console-only recovery.

> A tag does **not** disable expiry on its own; it has to be turned off explicitly per machine.
> Check any new node with `tailscale status --json` → `Self.KeyExpiry`; absent means disabled.
> There is no Tailscale API token in `.env`, so this is admin-console work: **Machines → select →
> ⋯ → Disable key expiry**. (The `TS_OAUTH_*` GitHub org secrets belong to the deploy action, and
> GitHub never returns secret values, so they cannot be reused for this.)

> **Getting back in if the tailnet is ever unavailable**: Hostinger's browser console (hPanel →
> VPS → Console). That is now the only path — plan any change that could drop tailscaled with
> that in mind.

> ⚠️ **We hold a console credential for bpvps1 only.** The console wants an OS login, and
> `PasswordAuthentication no` is set on all five hosts (verified 2026-08-27), so SSH passwords are
> useless anyway — the console is the only thing a password is still for. `.env` keeps
> `BPVPS1_USER`/`BPVPS1_PASSWORD` (root) for exactly that. The four `deploy` passwords that used to
> sit beside them were deleted on 2026-08-27: `deploy` has no sudo, so even a working console login
> as `deploy` could not fix a daemon. If you want real break-glass on vps1/vps2/vps3/bpvps2, set a
> root password on each (hPanel → VPS → Root password) and store it as `<HOST>_ROOT_PASSWORD`.

> `deploy` cannot enumerate `/root` (mode `drwx--x--x`) — a `find /` as `deploy` silently returns
> nothing. Search host paths as root, and search recursively: the 2026-08-09 `_preflight_*` cleanup
> first reported "absent" on VPS3 while 284 MB sat nested one level down inside a stack dir.

### Docker 29.x breaks Traefik's Docker provider — fix differs per VPS

Docker 29.x raises `MinAPIVersion` above 1.24. Traefik v3.3 **hardcodes** Docker API 1.24 and
ignores `DOCKER_API_VERSION`, so the daemon rejects it and Traefik loads **zero routes** — every
domain on that host 404s while the containers stay healthy. The fix is always daemon-side, but
the unit path depends on how Docker was installed:

| VPS | Docker install | systemd unit | Drop-in path |
|-----|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| VPS2, VPS3 | apt `docker-ce` | `docker.service` | `/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/min-api.conf` |
| **VPS1** | **snap** (`canonical/docker`) | **`snap.docker.dockerd.service`** | **`/etc/systemd/system/snap.docker.dockerd.service.d/min-api.conf`** |

Contents either way: `[Service]` + `Environment="DOCKER_MIN_API_VERSION=1.24"`, then
`systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart <unit>` (restarts all containers on that host).

> ⚠️ VPS1 runs the **snap** Docker — there is no `docker.service` there. A drop-in under
> `docker.service.d/` is silently inert. This is exactly how VPS1 sat fully 404 from
> 2026-05-10 to 2026-07-21. Verify with `systemctl list-units '*docker*'` before assuming
> the unit name. Must reapply if Docker is reinstalled.

### Shared Scripts

`vps/shared/` holds the CI helpers (see the `provision` skill); `scripts/backup.sh <bp-alias>` tars
every named volume on that host into `/home/deploy/backups/`.
