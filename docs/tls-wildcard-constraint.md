# bpvps2 cannot issue a wildcard certificate for `reservetoday.app`

Recorded 2026-08-31. **No action needed** — this is written down so it is not
rediscovered the next time someone asks "why aren't the frontends on the VPS?"

## The constraint

Traefik on bpvps2 has two ACME resolvers:

| Resolver | Challenge | Can do wildcards? |
|---|---|---|
| `le-tls` | TLS-ALPN-01 | **No** |
| `letsencrypt` | DNS-01 (Cloudflare) | Yes, but only for the Teeko zone |

`booking-be` uses `le-tls`. Two independent reasons block a wildcard:

1. **TLS-ALPN-01 cannot issue wildcards.** The challenge proves control of port 443
   for one exact hostname. Let's Encrypt only issues `*.example.com` off DNS-01.

2. **The DNS-01 resolver cannot reach the right Cloudflare account.**
   `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN` on this host is an org-level secret holding the **Teeko**
   token, scoped to `teeko.ai`. `reservetoday.app` lives in the **Blueprint**
   Cloudflare account. Traefik reads that token from the **process environment**,
   not per-resolver — so adding a second DNS-01 resolver for reservetoday.app
   would silently reuse the Teeko token and fail. bpvps1 has the opposite problem
   and overrides the token at the host level; bpvps2 cannot, because its Teeko
   certs would then break.

## What follows from it

- **The frontends stay on Vercel.** Vercel issues the wildcard certificates itself.
  This is the concrete reason, not a preference.
- **Every backend hostname on bpvps2 must be named explicitly**, one Traefik router
  rule per exact FQDN, with a DNS record to match.
- **A new backend hostname needs an explicit A record → 187.127.207.82 created
  first**, and that record is made **at Vercel**, not Cloudflare — see below.
  TLS-ALPN-01 proves control of port 443 on that IP, so without the record
  Traefik gets no certificate and the hostname serves a TLS handshake failure.
- **Keep the old hostname as a router alias through any rename**, until the new
  name is confirmed serving a valid certificate.

## Where `reservetoday.app` DNS actually lives — read this before editing anything

**Vercel is authoritative.** The zone's nameservers are `ns1.vercel-dns.com` and
`ns2.vercel-dns.com`. Manage records with `vercel dns ls|add|rm reservetoday.app`
under the `blueprintdigitalmy` scope.

**There is also a Cloudflare zone for `reservetoday.app` in the Blueprint account,
and it is NOT live.** It is a staged copy prepared for a nameserver move that has
not happened. Editing it changes nothing that resolves. Verified 2026-08-31: the
Cloudflare zone had no `api.dev` record while `api.dev.reservetoday.app` resolved
fine, because the answer was never coming from Cloudflare. Do not trust that zone
as a picture of reality until the nameservers actually move.

**The wildcard is a trap.** Vercel serves `* ALIAS cname.vercel-dns-016.com`, so a
hostname with no explicit record does **not** NXDOMAIN — it silently resolves to
Vercel and serves a Vercel certificate for someone else's name. A backend
hostname that "resolves" therefore proves nothing. Check the record exists:

```bash
vercel dns ls reservetoday.app | grep api
```

**CAA is already correct.** The zone publishes `0 issue "letsencrypt.org"` (plus
pki.goog and sectigo.com), so Let's Encrypt is permitted to issue. A new backend
hostname needs no CAA change.

## If this ever needs to change

Split Traefik's DNS-01 credentials per resolver. As of Traefik v3.3 the Cloudflare
provider still reads `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN` process-wide, so the realistic options are
a second Traefik instance, or moving `reservetoday.app` into the Teeko Cloudflare
account. Neither is worth it while Vercel fronts the customer-facing hosts.
